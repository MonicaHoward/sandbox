                <p>Long ago in a faraway land there lived a beautiful princess who had lovely red hair, and loved roses. Her name was princess Rose. Every evening, Princess Rose would come out on her balcony and clap her hands. On hearing her, a little golden bird would appear and sit on her shoulder. The princesses&rsquo; hair would glow with a beautiful red light, and she and the bird would sing a lullaby that would put everyone in the kingdom to sleep</p><br/>
                <p>One day a jealous witch cast a spell on Princess Rose and turned her lovely red hair black. That night when the bird and the princess sang, the people of the kingdom had nightmares and bad dreams. The bird told the princess to wash her hair in rose water, and all would be well again. The princess washed her hair with rose water, and people of the kingdom slept well.</p><br/>
                <p>When the evil witch heard this, she turned Princess Rose&rsquo;s hair black again, and this time she also made all the roses in the land disappear. As Princess Rose wept in despair, a Prince appeared with a strand of red hair. When her tears touched the hair, a beautiful red rose bloomed, and Princess Rose was able to make her hair red again. The Prince revealed that he and the princess had exchanged a strand of hair as children as a sign of loyalty..</p><br/>
                <p>The Prince and Princess Rose got married and lived happily ever after, and the evil Witch was so furious at the failure of her plan that she exploded into a thousand pieces.</p>
